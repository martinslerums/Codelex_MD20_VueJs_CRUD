      description: 'Speed is the rate at which a disc can travel through the air. Faster discs cut into the wind with less effort and are best when throwing upwind. Slower discs take more power to throw upwind, but theyâ€™re easier to throw more accurately and may actually go farther downwind. High-speed discs are not recommended for beginners as they require more power to fly properly.'

Beginners wanting more distance should choose discs with more glide. Discs with less glide are more accurate in high wind situations.'

Discs with less turn are more accurate in the wind. Discs with more turn are easier to throw for beginners.'

A disc rated 0 will finish straightest, while a disc rated 5 will hook hard at the end of the flight. High fade discs are usually used for Spike and Skip shots.'
