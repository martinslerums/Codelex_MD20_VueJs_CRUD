The Kaxe Z can handle a decent amount of speed and wind, but will also perform better than the typical driver when powered-down. With this disc we’re introducing the Z as in Zero, symbolizing less stability than the original mold.  Suitable for: Control shots, forehand shots, 1-disc rounds.",

Many people have described a lot of discs as a “faster TeeBird”, but this is the real deal. The flat flight plate promotes speed while reducing glide, effectively producing consistent, accurate flights. This is a point and shoot, target specific fairway driver. The TeeBird in it’s different forms is most likely the most popular fairway driver in the world.",
